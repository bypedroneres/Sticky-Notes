<h3>✺ Sticky Note Website ✺</h3>

The Sticky Note Website is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a digital version of sticky notes, allowing users to create and organize virtual notes for various purposes.

<h4>✹ Goal ✹</h4>

The main objective of the Sticky Note Website is to offer a virtual platform for users to create and manage digital sticky notes. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface that mimics the experience of physical sticky notes while offering additional features and convenience.

<h4>✹ Design ✹</h4>

The Sticky Note Website features a visually appealing design inspired by real-life sticky notes. The interface incorporates vibrant colors and textures to create a playful and engaging user experience. The notes are designed to resemble physical sticky notes, complete with draggable functionality for easy repositioning.

* <b>Event Handling:</b> Through the project, I gained experience in handling user interactions and responding to events such as clicks and drags, enabling a smooth and intuitive sticky note experience.
* <b>Data Persistence:</b> I learned how to utilize local storage or server-side storage to save and load data, allowing users to access their sticky notes across sessions.
